# FYS-STK4155 - Data Analysis and Machine Learning
This is the public repository for the master-subject FYS-STK4155 at the University of Oslo. It is the product of the collaboration between Mohamed Ismail, Jens Due and Oliver Hebnes. The subject consists of three main projects, where you will find more information resting within each repository.

# Project 1

## Regression Analysis and Resampling Methods
The main aim of this project is to study in more detail various regression methods, including the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, Ridge regression and finally Lasso regression. The methods are in turn combined with resampling techniques.

# Project 2

## Classification and Regression
The main aim of this project is to study both classification and regression problems. We will develop our own logistic regression for classification problems and write our own neural network code for studying both regression and classification problems.


# Project 3

## Partial Differential Equations & Eigenvalue Problems
In this project we will study partial differential equations using Forward Euler, Backward Euler, Crank-Nicolsen and a Neural Network.
In addition, we will also looking at eigenvalue problems using a neural network.
